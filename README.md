## Emissions Data Sources

- [Discover Magazine](https://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/whats-in-a-gallon-of-gas)
  - 100 tons of plant matter -> 1 gallon gasoline -> 20 lbs carbon dioxide
- [BlueSkyModel (gasoline)](http://www.blueskymodel.org/gallon-gas)
  - Chemically, 1 gallon gasoline -> 18 pounds carbon dioxide
  - However the US Energy Information Administration reported 19.6 pounds carbon dioxide, likely due to additional additives in gasoline you find at the pump
- [BlueSkyModel (air mile)](http://www.blueskymodel.org/air-mile)
  - 1 air mile -> 53 pounds of carbon dioxide (based on average of many types of commercial aircraft)
- [University of Utah](https://archive.unews.utah.edu/news_releases/bad-mileage-98-tons-of-plants-per-gallon/)
  - 98 tons of plant matter -> 1 gallon gasoline
  - 98 tons is equivalent to 40 acres of wheat
  - in 1997, humanity burned 400x all the plant matter that grows in the world in a year
